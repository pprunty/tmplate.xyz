  - [ ] Create stacked header in sidebar menu with nested route bar
  - [ ] Add primary, secondary keys in routes

for chatgpt:

1. How do I create an admin layout (desktop.tsx, mobile.tsx, index.tsx and header.tsx) using this Sidebar by modularizing
it into header.tsx, desktop.tsx and mobile.tsx with an index.tsx file which uses this middleware to show mobile/desktop menu.
2. How do I similarly create a basic layout (desktop.tsx, mobile.tsx, index.tsx and header.tsx) which uses a 
sticky header, main content and the same shared footer from the admin layout using the routes from this routes.tsx similar
to the admin layout. the header.tsx should be shared, used by both mobile and desktop and therefore responsive for different 
screens
3. How in this root layout.tsx, do i create a master layout component which reads from the config the type of layout to 
render (admin or basic)
4. how for this admin header and this basic header do i create a CTA component which both share and display on the right 
hand side
