    text: 'Thanks so much for crafting and sharing this app. Was just chatting with a friend about scanning via Notes[1], which is a little clunky for quickly and seamlessly sharing a scan. A few feature suggestions:\n* Allow setting default color mode (having to switch manually to B&W every time adds another step) * Allow setting setting type (PDF, JPG, TXT) and size (Original, Medium, Small) in Sharing Options à la Scanner Pro[2]* Allow sharing immediately after scanning rather than first having to tap Save then opening the image again',
